                Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was one of the great scientists and physicists of our time, truly one of the great minds of humanity. Below, we collect much of his wisdom in one place.
<br><strong>“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”</strong><br>
Richard Feynman lived from 1918 to 1988. He made his mark as an original genius, starting with his work on the Manhattan Project in his early twenties, through winning a Nobel Prize for his work in developing an understanding of quantum mechanics, and finally as a much-loved professor of undergraduate physics at Caltech.
His lectures continue to be available in many places, providing a deep, fundamental, intuitive way to understand physics.
The Feynman method of thought was developed by a man who refused conventional wisdom at all turns and who sought to build his mental computer from the ground up, starting with an understanding of mathematics at a very young age. (Feynman’s early notebooks are records of him deriving algebra, calculus, trigonometry, and various higher maths on his own, with original results and notation.)
This was how Feynman approached all knowledge: What can I know for sure, and how can I come to know it? It resulted in his famous quote, “You must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.” Feynman believed it and practiced it in all of his intellectual work.
<br><strong>
“When Feynman faces a problem, he’s unusually good at going back to being like a child, ignoring what everyone else thinks… He was so unstuck — if something didn’t work, he’d look at it another way.”
— Marvin Minsky, MIT
</strong><br>
Outside of pure physics, such thinking helped him arrived at such counterintuitive results as the solution he derived to the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster, which he took part in investigating. Feynman quickly realized that NASA had a disconnect among its engineers and its managers, and he concluded that “For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled”. His report on the reliability — or lack thereof — of the Space Shuttle is as famous for its incisive analysis as it is for his willingness to offer a controversial finding that placed blame.
Of course, Feynman was also famous for another reason: his practical jokes and his jovial, interesting public personality, revealed in stories and books like the famous collection of anecdotes Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman. Feynman was a ballbuster from an early age, telling stories of picking safes at the Manhattan Project and playing the bongos in Brazil, breaking the image of the buttoned-up physics professor.
What we take from Feynman is an absolute, unvarying pursuit of rationality and truth. Feynman would rather admit that he didn’t know something than believe in false knowledge.
Feynman was never one to settle for knowing the description of things or the accepted truths of things. Instead, he really wanted to know, and it was that burning curiosity that led him to his greatest work. Feynman was human, at times all too human, but his mind was devoted to figuring out reality the way it was.

Richard Feynman Quotes :
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird… I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don’t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we’re here. I don’t have to know an answer.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“I think for lesson number one, to learn a mystic formula for answering questions is very bad.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“In this age of specialization men who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent to discuss another. The great problems of the relations between one and another aspect of human activity have for this reason been discussed less and less in public.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“It doesn’t seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to… No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science [pseudoscience]… It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“I don’t like honors…I’ve already got the prize: the prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things.”
<br></strong><strong class="quotes">
“The only way to have real success in science, the field I’m familiar with, is to describe the evidence very carefully without regard to the way you feel it should be. If you have a theory, you must try to explain what’s good and what’s bad about it equally. In science, you learn a kind of standard integrity and honesty.”
