                <p>Richard Phillips Feynman ForMemRS (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an
                     American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum
                      mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of 
                      supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed 
                      the parton model. For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman 
                      received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.
                   Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing
                    the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime,
                     Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists
                      worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked as one of the ten 
                      greatest physicists of all time.[2]</p>
